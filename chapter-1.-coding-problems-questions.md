# Chapter - 1. Coding Problem Questions

Coding interviews are getting harder every day. Generally, coding interviews test the candidate ability to solve a problem using efficient algorithms and proper data structure. Also, the ability to map a new problem to an already known problem. Itâ€™s very important to ace coding interviews to proceed further in recruitment process.

**Q. Given an array of elements, return the length of the longest subarray where all its elements are distinct.**

For example, given the array `[5, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`, return 5 as the longest subarray of distinct elements is `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

```java
public class Solution {
    
    public int lengthOfLongestSubArray(int[] arr) {
        
    }
    
}
```
