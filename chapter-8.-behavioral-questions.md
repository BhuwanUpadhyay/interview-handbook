### **TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF?**

Keep it short and succinct, preferably no longer than 2 – 3 minutes.

What should your reply cover?  Make sure you have done your research on what the company expects from the successful applicant, so include information on your qualifications, personality and work experience \(making sure they are kept relevant to the position in question\). And avoid going into detail about personal life, family etc. at this early stage.

#### _Answer_

I am a software engineer with 6 years experience and write a good piece of software by involving myself in the complete product development life-cycle of successfully launched applications. I'm great at knowing the right algorithm for a problem and the suitable architecture for a business because I read software engineering books, articles, blog post constantly. I love working with people to do things bigger than I cold accomplish alone. I'm motivated by big problems that can challenge me. Also, I love to helps other and don't afraid to try new stuffs.

### **WHAT ARE YOUR WEAKNESSES?**

You can admit to those which you have that are irrelevant to the job in question. Whatever weaknesses you state, make sure your answer is a positive one by making sure you have examples of how you have overcome them in past roles.

### **WHAT IS YOUR GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT?**

This is a good opportunity to highlight how you can contribute to the company if you are successfully recruited, so focus on an achievement that applies to the position.

### **WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE DOING FIVE YEARS FROM NOW?**

### **WHY DO YOU WANT TO WORK WITH US?**

### **WHY DID YOU APPLY FOR THIS POSITION?**

### **WHY DID YOU LEAVE YOUR LAST JOB?**

### **WHY SHOULD WE HIRE YOU?**

### **WHAT ARE YOUR SALARY EXPECTATIONS?**

### **DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?**

It's your chance to finish the interview on a real positive. Even if you don’t believe this is the role for you, make sure you have at least 3 prepared questions and ask them. Replying that you’ve got nothing to ask will always leave the impression to the interviewer that you are not really interested in the job.
